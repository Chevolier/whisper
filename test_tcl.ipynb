      " Absolutely must be signed now. What's the latest reaction on social media? Same as before. Fear and anger. Anger directed at who? From the Prime Minister on down. CNN and the Irish Times want interviews with you. You can do tonight or tomorrow morning at 8. Tomorrow morning by phone. What else? You've a call waiting on line 2. Waiting? For 30 minutes now. A Mr. Kwan from London, very insistent. What does he want? His daughter was killed in the bombing. I tried my best to console him, but he really just wants to speak to you. Saw you on TV. Oh, Christ, Beth. Civic duty. Take it and be done. This is Liam Hennessey. How may I help you? What on earth makes you think I know who killed your daughter? Because you are the first deputy minister and advisor to Kunshan and a former UDI member. I'm truly sad for your loss, Mr. Kwan. I have a daughter myself, and I condemn these acts of violence, but I can't help you. Then please tell me someone whom I know the names of the bombers, Mr. Hennessy. You're a very powerful man. I work for the government and our elected officials. I do not work for terrorists. Politics and terrorism are different ends of the same snake. Whichever end you grab, you still grab a snake. It makes a great deal of difference which end you grab, because one end will bite... again. I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Korn. Good day. Nå er det en hel del av.你这是干什么你不能再这样继续下去了这不是你的错我没有好好保护他们这是什么以后这个餐厅就是你的了林你是我最好的知己别再跟我说这个看着我今天晚上我不回去我就睡外面的沙发星期一我会带你去见能够帮你的人但是你要答应我别再跟我提刚才乖 Thank you. Nettopp我给你打了一晚上电话你去哪了你要去干什么你什么时候回来 Bye. KAMU MENGALA You have a room? These are important documents that we must have today. Yes, I will keep trying this, Ender, because apparently there's nothing else I can do, which I find strange and certainly not the service I've come to expect. Yes, 329174N for November. You tell your supervisor I'll be calling back. Good day. Yes, may I help you? Please, I would like to speak to Mr Hennessy. And your name? Lu Ming Guan. You're the one who's been phoning? Yes, I've phoned many times. I'm afraid the Deputy Minister is busy and won't be able to see you. I will wait. No, you must leave. As do as the lady says. He's been phoning up at all hours asking for Liam. He won't take no for an answer. Just groceries. Go now, before we make you. No, I'm Wade. Right. It's a man who's been phoning you from London. He's got a knife in him. One of those Swiss Army types. Well, take it off him. Jesus, how much damage can he do with you two around? Let him be. As I explained before, I don't know who the bombers are. I realise you're angry, but there's not much I can do. It's also very dangerous for you to be here. People in Belfast won't take kindly to your accusations. If we do not know who they are, I would like you to please find out. I haven't been affiliated for 30 years. When I was, I fought hard against the violence. I went to prison for what I did and paid my debt. Now I serve the politics of both sides, trying to heal the wounds and bridge the divide. Again, my sincere condolences. There's nothing I can do. What if your wife and daughter were killed by bomb? I'd do everything in my power to get justice. So I've chosen you, Mr. Hennessy. You will tell me who killed my child. Again? I don't know. You will change your mind. Thank you for seeing me, First Minister Hennessy. KAMU MENGALA I'm sorry Liam, he took me by surprise. Please check the building. Would you like a whiskey, Inspector? No, thank you. I suppose it would be a waste of time asking who might have done this. No one comes to mind.\n"
